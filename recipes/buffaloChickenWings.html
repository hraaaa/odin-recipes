    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>This recipe is a modified, simpler version of the classic Buffalo Chicken Wings. <em>Hope you like it!</em></p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Wings<em>(preferably with skin)</em></li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Seasonings<em>(Salt and Pepper)</em></li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Garlic<em>(or Galic Powder)</em></li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Any Hot Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your Chicken Wings into 2 winglets<em>(unless you bought them like that)</em></li>
        <li>Make a few slashes into your chicken wings using a sharp knife</li>
        <li>Take your buttermilk, and add to it seasonings and paprika. Add a bit more than you think is appropriate for the quantity of chicken.</li>
        <li>Add your slashed chicken winglets to this buttermilk, and keep marinate for atleast 20 mins <em>(or overnight in your fridge)</em></li>
        <li>Pre heat your airfryer. Take the chicken winglets out of the buttermilk and dry them using a cloth/tissues <em>(make sure no paper is stuck is on them)</em></li>
        <li>Mince your garlic and mix it with any vegetable oil. Don't use butter as it will burn before the chicken is done cooking.</li>
        <li>Coat this garlic-oil on your winglets in a bowl, and pop them inside your hot airFryer.<br>Keep the airFryer at 170degree Celcius (340F) for 12 minutes. Check every 2 minutes after 8 minutues and adjust accordingly.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan on medium-low heat and melt your butter in it.</li>
        <li>After your butter is melted and starts to bubble up, add your hot sauce to it, keep stirring until it starts to bubble, and take it off the heat.<br>Keep 1:1 butter:hotSauce for best results, and adjust according to your spice preference.</li>
        <li>After the winglets are done cooking, put them into the butter-hotSauce mix, and coat the winglets thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot in a bowl/shallow plate. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
