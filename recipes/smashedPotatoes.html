    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>This recipe is a slightly modified version of <a href = "https://www.recipetineats.com/crispy-smashed-potatoes/" target="_blank">this</a> recipe, which involves shallow frying.<br>I wanted to give this recipe a healthier touch, but still be equally as tasty. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients:</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Small Potatoes</li>
        <li>Seasoning<em>(Salt and Pepper)</em></li>
        <li>Garlic<em>(or Garlic Powder)</em></li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Clarified Butter<em>(Ghee)</em></li>
        <li>Curd</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Coriander Leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water in a large pot. Add Salt and a bit of Pepper to it.</li>
        <li>Wash your potatoes and add them to this boiling water<em>(no need to peel the skin off)</em></li>
        <li>Boil the potatoes on medium-high heat for around 7mins, and check if they're cooked.<br>They should be soft enough for a knife to pass but should hold their shape.</li>
        <li>Strain the boiled potatoes and let them cool down.</li>
        <li>Take a knife and make 2 slashes in a plus form on the potatoes, and then use a Glass/Bowl's bottom to flatten them to about 1cm thickness.</li>
        <li>Mince your garlic and spread it on the top side of the smashed potatoes. Add Paprika, Salt and Pepper according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat your AirFryer at its max temp for around 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Spread a bit of clarified butter on the potatoes using a brush and put them in the air fryer.</li>
        <li>You only need to crispen up the top layer of the potatoes and cook the garlic. Hence put the AirFryer on its max temperature for 6 minutes><br>Check the potatoes 4 minutes in and adjust accordingly.</li>
        <li>Take them out and let them rest for 5 mins on a wire rack, so that the underside doesn't get soggy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Dipping Sauce:</em></h3>
    <p>Take your curd in a bowl, and add minced garlic, lemon juice, lightly chopped coriander leaves and season to taste.<br>Mix everything in the bowl using a spoon/fork, and <em>Voila! Your dipping sauce is ready!</em></p>
